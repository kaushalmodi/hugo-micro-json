*This is not a standalone theme. This is a Hugo theme component.*

To enable micro.json feeds for your site:

1. Clone this repo to ~<your-site-dir>/themes/hugo-micro-json~ directory.
2. Add these your site's ~config.toml~:
   - Add "hugo-micro-json" as the *left-most element* of the ~theme~ list
     variable. For example:
     #+begin_src toml
     theme = ["hugo-micro-json", "my-theme"]
     #+end_src
   - Add "Micro" to all the "list" Page Kinds for which you want to
     create micro.json feeds:
     #+begin_src toml
     [outputs]
       # <domain>/micro.json
       home = ["HTML", "RSS", "Micro"]     # default = ["HTML", "RSS"]
     #+end_src
