*This is not a standalone theme. This is a Hugo theme component.*

This component enables micro.json feeds for your site.

* Requirements
You need to install the latest version of Go from
https://go.dev/doc/install because this theme component requires [[https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/use-modules/][~hugo
mod ..~ commands]] to work.

This update on switch to using Hugo Modules was last tested with Hugo
v0.92.0.
* Installing
1. Add this component as a new module to your site's TOML config file:
   #+begin_src conf-toml
   [module]
     [[module.imports]]
       path = "github.com/kaushalmodi/hugo-micro-json"
   #+end_src
2. Add "Micro" to all the "list" Page Kinds for which you want to
   create micro.json feeds:
   #+begin_src conf-toml
   [outputs]
     # <domain>/micro.json
     home = ["HTML", "RSS", "Micro"]     # default = ["HTML", "RSS"]
   #+end_src
